    ///### Fulfillment Order Creation
    ///
    ///After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing process which determines
    ///which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items.
    ///Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders will be created

    ///### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location

    ///Fulfillment orders are completed by creating

    ///[send a fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitFulfillmentRequest)

    ///## API access scopes

    ///
    ///* The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
    ///  `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes
    ///  grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
    ///* The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`

    ///* The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
    ///  access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders
    ///  assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.
    ///
    ///### Fulfillment service app access scopes
    ///
    ///Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope
    ///and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
    ///or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes.

    ///(or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on the shop).

    ///or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.

    ///### Order management app access scopes
    ///
    ///**Order management apps** will usually request `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and

    ///To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to
    ///[Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps)
    ///guide.
    ///
    ///## Mutations
    ///
    ///You can work with the `FulfillmentService` object with the
    ///[fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate),
    ///[fulfillmentServiceUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceUpdate),
    ///and [fulfillmentServiceDelete](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceDelete)
    ///mutations.
    ///
    ///## Hosted endpoints
    ///
    ///Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with a set of hosted endpoints that
    ///Shopify can query on certain conditions.
    ///These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied in the `callbackUrl` parameter
    ///in the
    ///[fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate)
    ///mutation.
    ///
    ///- Shopify sends POST requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint
    ///  to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests,
    ///  if `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` is set to `true`.
    ///
    ///  [As of the 2022-07 API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/legacy-fulfillment-api-deprecation),
    ///  it's mandatory for a fulfillment service to follow a fulfillment order based workflow by
    ///  having `fulfillment_orders_opt_in` set to `true`,
    ///  hosting the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint, and acting on fulfillment requests and cancellations.
    ///
    ///  For more information, refer to
    ///  [Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations).
    ///- Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_tracking_numbers` endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders,
    ///  if `trackingSupport` is set to `true`.
    ///
    ///  For more information, refer to
    ///  [Enable tracking support](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-8-enable-tracking-support-optional).
    ///
    ///  Fulfillment services can also update tracking information with the
    ///  [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdateV2) mutation,
    ///  rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
    ///- Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve inventory levels,
    ///  if `inventoryManagement` is set to `true`.
    ///
    ///  For more information, refer to
    ///  [Sharing inventory levels with Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-9-share-inventory-levels-with-shopify-optional).

    ///To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints
    ///in your development store.
    ///
    ///## Resources and webhooks
    ///
    ///There are a variety of objects and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service to work.
    ///To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the
    ///[FulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder),
    ///[Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) and

    ///To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side,
    ///besides awaiting calls to `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints,
    ///fulfillment services can subscribe to the
    ///[fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)

When amounts are divided across multiple line items, such as taxes or order discounts, the amounts might not divide evenly across all of the line items on the order. To address this, the remaining currency units that couldn't be divided evenly are allocated one at a time, starting with the first line item, until they are all accounted for. In aggregate, the values sum up correctly. In isolation, one line item might have a different tax or discount amount than another line item of the same price, before taxes and discounts. This is because the amount could not be divided evenly across the items. The allocation of currency units across line items is immutable. After they are allocated, currency units are never reallocated or redistributed among the line items.
