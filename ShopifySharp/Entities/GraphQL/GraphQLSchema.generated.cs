When amounts are divided across multiple line items, such as taxes or order discounts, the amounts might not divide evenly across all of the line items on the order. To address this, the remaining currency units that couldn't be divided evenly are allocated one at a time, starting with the first line item, until they are all accounted for. In aggregate, the values sum up correctly. In isolation, one line item might have a different tax or discount amount than another line item of the same price, before taxes and discounts. This is because the amount could not be divided evenly across the items. The allocation of currency units across line items is immutable. After they are allocated, currency units are never reallocated or redistributed among the line items.
