/// ## Retrieving fulfillment orders
/// ### Fulfillment orders from an order
/// All fulfillment orders related to a given order can be retrieved with the
/// [Order.fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#connection-order-fulfillmentorders)
/// connection.
/// [API access scopes](#api-access-scopes)
/// govern which fulfillments orders are returned to clients.
/// An API client will only receive a subset of the fulfillment orders which belong to an order
/// if they don't have the necessary access scopes to view all of the fulfillment orders.
/// ### Fulfillment orders assigned to the app for fulfillment
/// Fulfillment service apps can retrieve the fulfillment orders which have been assigned to their locations with the
/// [assignedFulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/2024-07/objects/queryroot#connection-assignedfulfillmentorders)
/// connection.
/// Use the `assignmentStatus` argument to control whether all assigned fulfillment orders
/// should be returned or only those where a merchant has sent a
/// [fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrderMerchantRequest)
/// and it has yet to be responded to.
/// The API client must be granted the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope to access
/// the assigned fulfillment orders.
/// ### All fulfillment orders
/// Apps can retrieve all fulfillment orders with the
/// [fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/fulfillmentOrders)
/// query. This query returns all assigned, merchant-managed, and third-party fulfillment orders on the shop,
/// which are accessible to the app according to the
/// [fulfillment order access scopes](#api-access-scopes) it was granted with.
/// ## The lifecycle of a fulfillment order
/// ### Fulfillment Order Creation
/// After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing process which determines
/// which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items.
/// Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders will be created
/// and assigned to these locations. It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.
/// Once a fulfillment order has been created, it will have one of two different lifecycles depending on
/// the type of location which the fulfillment order is assigned to.
/// ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location
/// Fulfillment orders are completed by creating
/// [fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment).
/// Fulfillments represents the work done.
/// For digital products a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfilment once the digital asset
/// has been provisioned.
/// For example, in the case of a digital gift card, a merchant would to do this once
/// the gift card has been activated - before the email has been shipped.
/// On the other hand, for a traditional shipped order,
/// a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfillment after picking and packing the items relating
/// to a fulfillment order, but before the courier has collected the goods.
/// [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as an order management app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/manage-fulfillments).
/// ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a location which is managed by a fulfillment service
/// For fulfillment orders which are assigned to a location that is managed by a fulfillment service,
/// a merchant or an Order Management App can
/// [send a fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitFulfillmentRequest)
/// to the fulfillment service which operates the location to request that they fulfill the associated items.
/// A fulfillment service has the option to
/// [accept](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptFulfillmentRequest)
/// or [reject](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderRejectFulfillmentRequest)
/// this fulfillment request.
/// Once the fulfillment service has accepted the request, the request can no longer be cancelled by the merchant
/// or order management app and instead a
/// [cancellation request must be submitted](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitCancellationRequest)
/// to the fulfillment service.
/// Once a fulfillment service accepts a fulfillment request,
/// then after they are ready to pack items and send them for delivery, they create fulfillments with the
/// [fulfillmentCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)
/// mutation.
/// They can provide tracking information right away or create fulfillments without it and then
/// update the tracking information for fulfillments with the
/// [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)
/// mutation.
/// [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as a fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments).
/// ## API access scopes
/// Fulfillment orders are governed by the following API access scopes:
/// * The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
///   `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes
///   grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
/// * The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`
///   access scopes are intended for fulfillment services.
///   These scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations that are being managed
///   by fulfillment services.
/// * The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
///   access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders
///   assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.
/// ### Fulfillment service app access scopes
/// Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope
/// and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
/// or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes.
/// The app will only have access to the fulfillment orders assigned to their location
/// (or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on the shop).
/// The app will not have access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations
/// or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.
/// ### Order management app access scopes
/// **Order management apps** will usually request `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
/// `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. This will allow them to manage all fulfillment orders
/// on behalf of a merchant.
/// If an app combines the functions of an order management app and a fulfillment service,
/// then the app should request all
/// access scopes to manage all assigned and all unassigned fulfillment orders.
/// ## Notifications about fulfillment orders
/// Fulfillment services are required to
/// [register](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService)
/// a self-hosted callback URL which has a number of uses. One of these uses is that this callback URL will be notified
/// whenever a merchant submits a fulfillment or cancellation request.
/// Both merchants and apps can
/// [subscribe](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
/// to the
/// [fulfillment order webhooks](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic#value-fulfillmentorderscancellationrequestaccepted)
/// to be notified whenever fulfillment order related domain events occur.
/// [Learn about fulfillment workflows](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment).
