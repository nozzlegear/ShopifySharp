/// You can use the `MobilePlatformApplication` resource to enable
/// [shared web credentials](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/shared_web_credentials) for Shopify iOS apps,
/// as well as to create [iOS universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/)
/// or [Android app link](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/)
/// verification endpoints for merchant Shopify iOS or Android apps.
/// Shared web credentials let iOS users access a native app after logging into the
/// respective website in Safari without re-entering
/// their username and password. If a user changes their credentials in the app, then those changes are reflected in Safari.
/// You must use a custom domain to integrate shared web credentials with Shopify. With each platform's link system,
/// users can tap a link to a shop's website and get seamlessly redirected to a merchant's installed app without going
/// through a browser or manually selecting an app.
/// For full configuration instructions on iOS shared web credentials,
/// see the [associated domains setup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/setting_up_an_app_s_associated_domains)
/// technical documentation.
/// For full configuration instructions on iOS universal links or Android App Links,
/// see the respective [iOS universal link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content)
