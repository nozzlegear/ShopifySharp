/// <summary>
/// A carrier service (also known as a carrier calculated service or shipping
/// service) provides real-time shipping rates to Shopify. Some common carrier
/// services include Canada Post, FedEx, UPS, and USPS. The term **carrier** is
/// often used interchangeably with the terms **shipping company** and **rate provider**.
/// Using the CarrierService resource, you can add a carrier service to a shop and
/// then provide a list of applicable shipping rates at checkout. You can even use
/// the cart data to adjust shipping rates and offer shipping discounts based on
/// what is in the customer's cart.
/// ## Requirements for accessing the CarrierService resource
/// To access the CarrierService resource, add the `write_shipping` permission to
/// your app's requested scopes. For more information, see [API access
/// scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/access-scopes).
/// Your app's request to create a carrier service will fail unless the store
/// installing your carrier service meets one of the following requirements:
/// * It's on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher.
/// * It's on the Shopify plan with yearly billing, or the carrier service feature
/// has been added to the store for a monthly fee. For more information, contact
/// [Shopify Support](https://help.shopify.com/questions).
/// * It's a development store.
/// > Note:
/// > If a store changes its Shopify plan, then the store's association with a
/// carrier service is deactivated if the store no long meets one of the
/// requirements above.
/// ## Providing shipping rates to Shopify
/// When adding a carrier service to a store, you need to provide a POST endpoint
/// rooted in the `callbackUrl` property where Shopify can retrieve applicable
/// shipping rates. The callback URL should be a public endpoint that expects these
/// requests from Shopify.
/// ### Example shipping rate request sent to a carrier service
/// ```json
/// {
///   "rate": {
///     "origin": {
///       "country": "CA",
///       "postal_code": "K2P1L4",

/// The `address3`, `fax`, `address_type`, and `company_name` fields are returned by
/// specific [ActiveShipping](https://github.com/Shopify/active_shipping) providers.
/// For API-created carrier services, you should use only the following shipping
/// address fields:
/// * `address1`
/// * `address2`
/// * `city`
/// * `zip`
/// * `province`
/// * `country`
/// Other values remain as `null` and are not sent to the callback URL.
/// ### Response fields
/// When Shopify requests shipping rates using your callback URL, the response
/// object `rates` must be a JSON array of objects with the following fields. 
/// Required fields must be included in the response for the carrier service
/// integration to work properly.
/// | Field                   | Required | Description

/// ### Special conditions
/// * To indicate that this carrier service cannot handle this shipping request,
/// return an empty array and any successful (20x) HTTP code.
/// * To force backup rates instead, return a 40x or 50x HTTP code with any content.
/// A good choice is the regular 404 Not Found code.
/// * Redirects (30x codes) will only be followed for the same domain as the
/// original callback URL. Attempting to redirect to a different domain will trigger backup rates.
/// * There is no retry mechanism. The response must be successful on the first try,
/// within the time budget listed below. Timeouts or errors will trigger backup rates.
/// ## Response Timeouts
/// The read timeout for rate requests are dynamic, based on the number of requests
/// per minute (RPM). These limits are applied to each shop-app pair. The timeout
/// values are as follows.
/// | RPM Range     | Timeout    |
/// | ------------- | ---------- |
/// | Under 1500    | 10s        |
/// | 1500 to 3000  | 5s         |
/// | Over 3000     | 3s         |
/// > Note:
/// > These values are upper limits and should not be interpretted as a goal to
/// develop towards. Shopify is constantly evaluating the performance of the
/// platform and working towards improving resilience as well as app capabilities.
/// As such, these numbers may be adjusted outside of our normal versioning timelines.
/// ## Server-side caching of requests
/// Shopify provides server-side caching to reduce the number of requests it makes.
/// Any shipping rate request that identically matches the following fields will be
/// retrieved from Shopify's cache of the initial response:
/// * variant IDs
/// * default shipping box weight and dimensions
/// * variant quantities
/// * carrier service ID
/// * origin address
/// * destination address
/// * item weights and signatures
/// If any of these fields differ, or if the cache has expired since the original
/// request, then new shipping rates are requested. The cache expires 15 minutes
/// after rates are successfully returned. If an error occurs, then the cache
/// expires after 30 seconds.
