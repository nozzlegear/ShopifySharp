/// <summary>
/// The `Collection` object represents a group of [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product)
/// that merchants can organize to make their stores easier to browse and help customers find related products.
/// Collections serve as the primary way to categorize and display products across
/// [online stores](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/online-store),
/// [sales channels](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/sales-channels), and marketing campaigns.
/// There are two types of collections:
/// - **[Custom (manual) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/manual-shopify-collection)**:
/// You specify the products to include in a collection.
/// - **[Smart (automated) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/automated-collections)**:
/// You define rules, and products matching those rules are automatically included
/// in the collection.
/// The `Collection` object provides information to:
/// - Organize products by category, season, or promotion.
/// - Automate product grouping using rules (for example, by tag, type, or price).
/// - Configure product sorting and display order (for example, alphabetical, best-selling, price, or manual).
/// - Manage collection visibility and publication across sales channels.
/// - Add rich descriptions, images, and metadata to enhance discovery.
/// > Note:
/// > Collections are unpublished by default. To make them available to customers,
/// use the [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish)
/// mutation after creation.
/// Collections can be displayed in a store with Shopify's theme system through [Liquid templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/collection)
/// and can be customized with [template suffixes](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/alternate-templates)
/// for unique layouts. They also support advanced features like translated content, resource feedback,
/// and contextual publication for location-based catalogs.
