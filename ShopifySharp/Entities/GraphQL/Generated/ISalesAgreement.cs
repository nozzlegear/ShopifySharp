/// a customer places an order, Shopify creates the order, generates a sales
/// agreement, and records a sale for each line item purchased in the order. A sale
/// record is specific to a type of order line. Order lines can represent different
/// things such as a purchased product, a tip added by a customer, shipping costs
/// collected at checkout, and more.
