/// <summary>
/// The `OrderTransaction` object represents a payment transaction that's associated with an order. An order
/// transaction is a specific action or event that happens within the context of an order, such as a customer paying
/// for a purchase or receiving a refund, or other payment-related activity.
/// Use the `OrderTransaction` object to capture the complete lifecycle of a payment, from initial
/// authorization to final settlement, including refunds and currency exchanges. Common use cases for using the
/// `OrderTransaction` object include:
/// - Processing new payments for orders
/// - Managing payment authorizations and captures
/// - Processing refunds for returned items
/// - Tracking payment status and errors
/// - Managing multi-currency transactions
/// - Handling payment gateway integrations
/// Each `OrderTransaction` object has a [`kind`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/OrderTransactionKind)
/// that defines the type of transaction and a [`status`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/OrderTransactionStatus)
/// that indicates the current state of the transaction. The object stores detailed information about payment
/// methods, gateway processing, and settlement details.
/// Learn more about [payment processing](https://help.shopify.com/manual/payments)
/// and [payment gateway integrations](https://www.shopify.com/ca/payment-gateways).
