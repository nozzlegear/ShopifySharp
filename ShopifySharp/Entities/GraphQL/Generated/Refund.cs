/// <summary>
/// The `Refund` object represents a financial record of money returned to a customer from an order.
/// It provides a comprehensive view of all refunded amounts, transactions, and restocking instructions
/// associated with returning products or correcting order issues.
/// The `Refund` object provides information to:
/// - Process customer returns and issue payments back to customers
/// - Handle partial or full refunds for line items with optional inventory restocking
/// - Refund shipping costs, duties, and additional fees
/// - Issue store credit refunds as an alternative to original payment method returns
/// - Track and reconcile all financial transactions related to refunds
/// Each `Refund` object maintains detailed records of what was refunded, how much was refunded,
/// which payment transactions were involved, and any inventory restocking that occurred. The refund
/// can include multiple components such as product line items, shipping charges, taxes, duties, and
/// additional fees, all calculated with proper currency handling for international orders.
/// Refunds are always associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)
/// and can optionally be linked to a [return](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Return)
/// if the refund was initiated through the returns process. The refund tracks both the presentment currency
/// (what the customer sees) and the shop currency for accurate financial reporting.
/// > Note:
/// > The existence of a `Refund` object doesn't guarantee that the money has been returned to the customer.
/// > The actual financial processing happens through associated
/// > [`OrderTransaction`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction)
/// > objects, which can be in various states, such as pending, processing, success, or failure.
/// > To determine if money has actually been refunded, check the
/// > [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction#field-OrderTransaction.fields.status)
/// > of the associated transactions.
/// Learn more about
/// [managing returns](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/build-return-management),
